# Foundry VTT Manual Testing Guide: Single-Shot Firearm Resolution

This guide outlines the step-by-step verification process for the Corebook Fidelity single-shot combat resolver path in **Foundry VTT**. Use this document to manually audit UI/UX flows, sheet updates, and chat log output.

---

## 1. Environment & Setup

Ensure the system is loaded in a clean test world, and the following components are available on the active scene:

### 1.1 Attacker Setup
1. Create a new Actor named **Solo (Attacker)**.
2. Open the actor sheet and navigate to the **Combat** tab.
3. Add a Ranged Weapon:
   - **Name**: Heavy Pistol
   - **Damage**: `4d6`
   - **Shots**: `10` / `10`
   - **RoF**: `2`
   - **Reliability**: `standard`
   - **Range**: `50`m
   - **Accuracy**: `0`
4. Set attacker stats:
   - **REF**: `8`
   - **Handgun Skill**: `6`

### 1.2 Target Setup
1. Create a new Actor named **Target (Defender)**.
2. Open the actor sheet, navigate to **Gear**, and add an Armor item:
   - **Name**: Kevlar Vest
   - **Equipped**: Yes
   - **SP (Torso)**: `12`
3. Set defender stats:
   - **BODY**: `6` (BTM: `-2`)
4. Create a token on the active scene for both the Attacker and the Target.

---

## 2. Standard Attack Flow (Confirm Path)

Verify that a standard single-shot ranged attack resolves, prompts preview confirmation, mutates stats on confirm, and updates the chat card in-place.

### 2.1 Target Selection
1. Select the **Solo (Attacker)** token.
2. Use Foundry's Target tool (or double right-click / Alt+click depending on config) to target the **Target (Defender)** token on the scene.
3. Verify that the targeting reticle is visible on the Target token.

### 2.2 Initiating the Roll
1. Open the **Solo (Attacker)** actor sheet.
2. In the **Combat** tab, find the **Heavy Pistol** and click the roll button (dice icon).
3. The Ranged Attack Modifier Dialog should appear:
   - Select **Semi-Auto** or **Single Shot** fire mode.
   - Select the target range (e.g., **Medium**).
   - Leave other modifiers default or specify aim rounds if desired.
   - Click **Roll**.

### 2.3 Preview Dialog Validation
1. An in-progress combat preview dialog should appear on screen.
2. Confirm the displayed values in the dialog:
   - **Attacker**: "Solo" using "Heavy Pistol"
   - **Target**: "Target"
   - **Attack roll**: Verify the total (1d10 + REF 8 + Handgun 6 + Accuracy) against the Target Number (Medium DC: 20).
   - **Hit/Miss status**: Confirm it correctly identifies a **Hit** if the total is >= 20, or **Miss** if < 20.
   - **Ammo change**: Displays `-1` spent (Shots: `9 / 10`).
   - **Wound Transition & Damage**: Summarizes final damage (if hit) taking into account Kevlar Vest SP (12) and BTM (-2). *Note: This calculation assumes the hit lands on the Torso (either rolled randomly or aimed); hits to unarmored body locations will not apply the Kevlar Vest's SP.*
   - **Warnings**: Ensure no unexpected warnings are displayed.

### 2.4 Committing the Outcome
1. Click **Confirm** on the preview dialog.
2. **Verify Sheet Mutations (Database changes)**:
   - Open **Solo (Attacker)** sheet: verify ammo is decremented by 1 (Shots Left: `9`).
   - Open **Target (Defender)** sheet (if a hit occurred and damage penetrated SP): verify damage is increased by final damage value, and Kevlar Vest SP on Torso is ablated by 1 (SP: `11`). *Note: In Cyberpunk 2020, armor is only ablated if the damage exceeds the stopping power (damage > SP). If damage <= SP, no damage is taken and armor SP is not ablated.*
3. **Verify Chat Card**:
   - Locate the generated chat card in the Foundry chat log.
   - Confirm the banner status displays **[COMMITTED] - Applied to Actor(s)** in a green border.
   - Confirm no duplicate chat cards were created (only one card exists for this attack).

---

## 3. Standard Attack Flow (Cancel Path)

Verify that canceling a roll updates the chat card status in-place and leaves database stats untouched.

### 3.1 Flow Execution
1. Ensure the attacker has targets selected and initiate a weapon roll as in Section 2.
2. When the preview dialog appears, inspect the values, then click **Cancel**.

### 3.2 Verification
1. **Verify Sheet State**:
   - Open Attacker sheet: Ammo must **not** be decremented (remains at the pre-attack count).
   - Open Target sheet: Damage and armor SP must **not** be mutated.
2. **Verify Chat Card**:
   - Locate the chat card in the log.
   - Confirm the banner status is updated in-place to **[CANCELED] - Discarded** in a red border.
   - Confirm no database changes were applied.

---

## 4. Manual Resolution Fallbacks

Verify that missing actor context or state conflicts block the commit path and alert the referee.

### 4.1 Missing Target Actor Context
1. Place a token on the scene that is **not** linked to any Actor (e.g., an actorless token template).
2. Select the Attacker and target this actorless token.
3. Initiate an attack.
4. Verify the preview Dialog pops up and:
   - Displays a warning banner: **Target Actor is unavailable; resolve target damage, armor, and saves manually.**
   - Disables the **Confirm** action, forcing manual GM resolution.
5. Click **GM Resolution** (or the corresponding manual confirmation button). *Note: Only users with Gamemaster (GM) permissions in Foundry VTT will see or be allowed to resolve this fallback path.*
6. Verify the chat card updates in-place to **[MANUAL] - Requires GM Resolution** in a yellow/orange banner.
7. Open the Target (Defender) sheet and manually apply the damage to the Wound Tracker and decrement armor SP (if appropriate) according to the GM's manual calculations.

### 4.2 Insufficient Ammo Warning
1. Set the Attacker's weapon ammo count to `0` on the actor sheet.
2. Target the Defender and initiate a roll.
3. Verify the preview dialog displays a warning: **Insufficient ammo to perform attack.**
4. Confirm the commit action is blocked or marked for manual resolution.

---

## 5. Running Automated Fixtures

To execute the automated suite of deterministic combat fixtures (verifying normalization, outcomes, hit locations, and fallbacks in code):
1. Open a terminal in the project root directory.
2. Run the command: `node tests/run-combat-fixtures.mjs`.
3. Verify that the output displays `2 combat fixture(s) passed`.

---

## 6. Epic 3 Damage Pipeline & Save Resolution (Manual Checks)

Verify that the core combat resolver faithfully applies the Cyberpunk 2020 damage pipeline rules, including armor penetration, layering, cover, head/limb criticals, BTM minimums, and save prompts.

### 6.1 Armor Piercing (AP) & Staged Penetration
1. Set up an Attacker with an AP weapon (e.g., Heavy Pistol with AP enabled in item snapshot: `weapon.snapshot.ap = true`).
2. Target a Defender with **Kevlar Vest (SP 12)** on the Torso.
3. Roll a hit:
   - In the preview dialog, verify that the effective stopping power is halved to **6**.
   - If raw damage is 8 (higher than effective SP 6), final damage penetrates.
   - Verify that confirming the hit ablates the Kevlar Vest by 1 (SP becomes **11** on the actor sheet).
4. If staged penetration is disabled (e.g., config/option `stagedPenetration: false`):
   - Verify that the Kevlar Vest SP is **not** ablated on the actor sheet upon confirmation.

### 6.2 Armor Layering & Cover
1. Equip the Defender with multiple armor layers (e.g., **Skinweave SP 8** and **Kevlar Vest SP 12**).
2. Set up a Ranged Attack option with cover (e.g., **Concrete Barrier SP 10**).
3. Verify the effective stopping power calculation:
   - The outer cover layer (Concrete Barrier, SP 10) resolves first.
   - The armor layers combine using proportional layering rules.
4. Roll a hit:
   - Confirm that only the outermost penetrated layer (e.g., Cover, or Kevlar Vest if cover is bypassed) is ablated.
   - Confirm that inner layers (like Skinweave) are left unablated on confirmation.

### 6.3 Body Type Mitigation (BTM) & Minimum Damage
1. Set Defender stats: **BODY 6** (BTM: `-2`).
2. Roll a hit that results in **3** penetrating damage (after armor SP subtraction):
   - Verify that the preview dialog applies BTM `-2` and lists the final damage as **1** (`3 - 2 = 1`).
3. Roll a hit that results in **1** penetrating damage:
   - Verify that the preview dialog lists the final damage as **1** (minimum damage rule applies instead of reducing it to `-1` or `0`).

### 6.4 Head Hits & Limb Damage Thresholds
1. Roll a hit to the **Head**:
   - Verify that the final damage is doubled in the preview dialog.
   - If the final damage exceeds 8 (e.g., 5 base x 2 = 10), verify that the preview displays a warning: **"Head hit exceeded 8 damage... target is killed automatically..."**.
2. Roll a hit to a **Limb** (Arm/Leg):
   - If the final damage exceeds 8, verify that the preview displays a warning: **"Limb hit exceeded 8 damage... limb is severed or crushed..."**.

### 6.5 Stun/Shock & Death Save Prompts
1. Roll an attack that inflicts damage, putting the target into a **Serious** or **Critical** wound state (damage <= 12):
   - Verify that the preview lists a pending **Stun Save** prompt.
   - Verify the save threshold/target number incorporates the wound penalty (Serious: `-1`, Critical: `-2`).
2. Roll an attack that puts the target into a **Mortal** wound state (damage >= 13):
   - Verify that the preview lists both a pending **Stun Save** (penalty `-3`) and a pending **Death Save** (penalty `0`).
3. Target an already **Mortal** defender and roll a stopped hit (0 damage):
   - Verify that the preview lists a pending **recurring Death Save reminder** (to remind the GM/player to roll death saves each turn).
4. Verify that confirming these states persists the damage updates on the target sheet, and the pending saves are printed to the chat card for player/GM resolution.

## 7. Epic 4 Automatic Fire (Manual Checks)

Verify that three-round burst, full auto (single and multi-target), suppressive fire, and jam/reliability behavior in automatic fire modes produce correct preview/confirm flows, ammo accounting, hit count/damage, and chat evidence.

### 7.1 Environment Setup
Create a clean Foundry test world with:
- **Attacker**: Create a character named **Solo (Attacker)** with:
  - **REF**: `8`, **Rifle Skill**: `6`
  - **Assault Rifle** (auto weapon): Damage `4d6`, Shots `30` / `30`, RoF `30`, Standard reliability, Range `400`m, Accuracy `0`
  - **Backup Very Reliable weapon**: Copy the assault rifle, set reliability to `"VeryReliable"`
  - **Backup Semi-Auto weapon**: A pistol with handgun skill (for Section 7.7 semi-auto check)
- **Targets**: Three NPC actors named **Target A**, **Target B**, **Target C**, each with:
  - **BODY**: `6` (BTM: `-2`)
  - **Kevlar Vest**: SP `12` on Torso, equipped
  - Place all tokens on an active scene

### 7.2 Three-Round Burst
1. Target **Target A** with Foundry's targeting tool.
2. Open Solo's sheet → Combat tab → click the Assault Rifle roll button.
3. In the modifiers dialog, select **Three-Round Burst** fire mode at **Medium** range, click Roll.
4. ✅ Fire mode dropdown shows **"Three-Round Burst"** (not hidden, not disabled).
5. ✅ Preview dialog shows **3 rounds expended**, ammo: `30 - 3 = 27`, hit count based on burst roll (1d3) capped by margin.
6. ✅ Preview shows a `[COMMITTED]` button and a `[CANCEL]` button.
7. Click **Confirm**:
   - ✅ Chat card updates to `[COMMITTED]` banner (green).
   - ✅ Chat card displays burst hit count, ammo delta `-3`, damage per hit with location/armor/penetration.
   - ✅ Attacker sheet ammo shows `27`.
8. Repeat with weapon set to **1 round left**:
   - ✅ Preview shows **1 round expended**, burst_hits capped at 1, ammo: `1 - 1 = 0`.
9. Try attacking with **0 rounds**:
   - ✅ Preview shows insuffient ammo warning, `[CONFIRM]` is blocked or marked manual.

### 7.3 Full Auto, Single Target
1. Reload weapon to 30 shots. Target **Target B**.
2. Select **Full Auto** fire mode, **Close** range, click Roll.
3. ✅ Preview dialog shows ammo delta = `30` (min(shotsLeft=30, ROF=30) = 30).
4. ✅ Hit count = `Math.min(roundsFired, margin)` capped at rounds fired.
5. ✅ Chat card shows full auto details, hit locations, damage per hit, ammo delta `-30`.
6. ✅ Confirm: attacker ammo = `0`.
7. Reload to 30 shots, select **Long** range:

8. Select **Medium** range with 10 shots:
   - ✅ Preview shows ammo delta = 10, full auto `-1` modifier (`-1 * Math.floor(10/10)`).

### 7.4 Full Auto, Multi-Target
1. Reload weapon to 30 shots. Target **Target B** and **Target C** (2 targets).
2. Select **Full Auto**, **Close** range, click Roll.
3. ✅ Preview dialog shows per-target outcomes:
   - Rounds per target = `Math.floor(30 / 2) = 15`.
   - Ammo delta = `30`.
4. ✅ Chat card shows each target's outcomes with separate hit/miss, locations, damage.
5. On confirm:
   - ✅ Attacker ammo = `0`.
   - ✅ Each target's damage/armor updated per hit count.
6. Target all three NPCs, reload weapon to 25 shots:
   - ✅ Rounds per target = `Math.floor(25 / 3) = 8`, ammo delta = `24` (1 round left over).
   - ✅ Third target rounds fire normally.

### 7.5 Suppressive Fire — Hidden When Fidelity ON
1. Ensure **Corebook Fidelity Mode** setting is **ON** (default).
2. Open Solo's sheet, select Assault Rifle, open modifiers dialog.
3. ✅ **"Suppressive"** is **NOT** visible in the fire mode dropdown.
4. ✅ Only Semi-Auto, Three-Round Burst, and Full Auto are visible.

### 7.6 Suppressive Fire — Warning When Fidelity OFF
1. Open World Settings → toggle **Corebook Fidelity Mode** to **OFF**.
2. Target any NPC, select **Suppressive** fire mode, any range, click Roll.
3. ✅ A warning notification appears: **"Suppressive fire not supported without zone width and rounds fired inputs."**
4. ✅ Chat card shows manual-resolution status (`[MANUAL]`), no hits applied, no ammo deducted.
5. Reset Corebook Fidelity Mode to **ON**.

### 7.7 Jam and Reliability
1. Ensure attacker has a **Standard reliability** auto weapon with full ammo (30 shots).
2. Target an NPC, roll full auto attacks repeatedly until a **natural 1** occurs on the attack d10.
3. ✅ On natural 1 with Standard reliability:
   - Chat card shows jam warning (`isJam: true`), hit forced false.
   - Ammo **is** deducted (full ROF).
   - `[PENDING DECISION]` jam indicator visible in chat card.
4. Switch to a **Very Reliable** weapon (edit item or create one).
5. Roll until natural 1:
   - ✅ On natural 1, no jam warning, just a miss (`hit: false`, no `isJam`).
   - Ammo **is** deducted.
6. Load a **semi-auto** weapon (non-automatic).
7. Roll until natural 1:
   - ✅ No jam, standard fumble miss only (no `isJam` on roll).

### 7.8 Ammo Consistency
1. Set weapon to exactly **5 rounds** remaining.
2. Full auto at Close range (ROF ≥ 10).
3. ✅ Preview shows ammo delta = **5** (not ROF — bounded by `shotsLeft`).
4. Confirm, verify ammo = **0**, no negative values.
5. Try another attack with **0 ammo**:
   - ✅ Preview shows ammo warning, commit is blocked or marked manual.
6. Set weapon to **1 round**, select **Three-Round Burst**:
