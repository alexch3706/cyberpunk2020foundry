## Reuse Patterns

- Templates favor shared field partials over repeated raw inputs.
- Dynamic item partial selection is based on `item.type`.
- Sheet events use CSS classes and `data-*` attributes.
- Localization is mostly centralized through `CPLocal`, `CPLocalParam`, and helper wrappers.

## UI Refactor Notes

- Keep current Handlebars partial structure unless replacing a whole sheet surface intentionally.
- The actor sheet is workable but mixes display, direct edit fields, and action triggers in tight templates.
- The item sheet has a clean dynamic partial pattern worth preserving.
- Vehicle and weapon settings templates are comparatively dense and would benefit from smaller subpartials if actively modified.
