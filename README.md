# cyberpunk2020 — for FoundryVTT

> *R. Talsorian Games' [Cyberpunk 2020](https://talsorianstore.com/products/cyberpunk-2020) for FoundryVTT. Time to get chromed, and frag some slags.*

A FoundryVTT game system package (version **0.3.12**) — not a standalone app. Loaded by Foundry through `system.json`, runs as ES modules in the Foundry client, renders Handlebars sheets, and ships with full item compendia.

## What's Here

Everything you need to run Cyberpunk 2020 combat faithfully to the core rules:

### Characters & Sheets

- **Full character sheet** — stats, skills (searchable, sortable), damage tracking, combat tab, gear inventory, cyberware, life notes.
- **NPCs** share the same data model and sheet.
- **Skills as items** — each skill is its own item with level, IP, chip level, stat association, and role-skill flag. Rollable from the sheet.
- **Armor** — per-location coverage, stopping power, encumbrance tracked per equipped piece.

### Combat Resolver

The project has a dedicated **mechanics resolver** (`module/combat/`) that produces structured, auditable combat outcomes — no more silent arithmetic.

#### Ranged Combat

| Fire Mode | Status |
|---|---|
| **Semi-auto / single shot** | ✅ Full resolution: attack roll, range DCs, modifiers, hit/miss, location, ammo |
| **Three-round burst** | ✅ Corebook burst rules: close/medium advantage, 1d3 hits, ammo |
| **Full auto — one target** | ✅ ROF, margin-based hits, damage per hit, ammo |
| **Full auto — multiple targets** | ✅ ROF division, per-target range context, rounding |
| **Suppressive fire** | ✅ Zone width, save DC (rounds÷width), Athletics+REF saves per target, failed-save hit allocation |

#### Damage Pipeline

| Mechanic | Status |
|---|---|
| **Hit locations** — random and aimed | ✅ Target-aware, uses target's own location model |
| **Armor layering** — proportional SP | ✅ Per-location, hard/soft constraints flagged |
| **Cover** | ✅ Manual cover input; scene cover deferred |
| **Armor Piercing (AP)** | ✅ Halves armor SP, then halves penetrating damage |
| **Staged penetration / ablation** | ✅ Explicit, auditable, configurable toggle (`stagedPenetration`) |
| **Body Type Modifier (BTM)** | ✅ Full BTM table, minimum damage = 1 enforcement |
| **Wound states** — Light → Mortal 9+ | ✅ Head-hit double damage, limb loss, critical injuries surfaced |
| **Stun / Death saves** | ✅ Threshold from Body Type + wound state, pending/passed/failed |
| **Reliability & jams** | ✅ Standard vs Unreliable jam outcomes, non-auto fumbles distinguished |

#### Melee & Martial Arts

| Mechanic | Status |
|---|---|
| **Opposed melee** (REF+skill+1d10 vs defender) | ✅ Case-insensitive skill matching, brawling fallback |
| **Body Type damage modifiers** | ✅ Corebook strength-damage table |
| **All martial arts styles & key technique bonuses** | ✅ 12 styles + Brawling, each with key technique data |
| **Martial actions** — strike, kick, block/parry, dodge, disarm, sweep/trip, grapple, hold, choke, throw, escape | ✅ Each produces an action-specific opposed outcome |
| **Grapple prerequisite enforcement** | ✅ Throw, hold, choke, escape check combat state before proceeding |

#### Usability

- **Preview/confirm damage** — lightweight dialog shows planned state changes (ammo, damage, armor, wounds) before commit.
- **Commit/rollback** — you can cancel and nothing persists.
- **Chat evidence** — structured chat cards show every intermediate value for referee audit.
- **Corebook Fidelity Mode** (`corebookFidelityMode` setting) — enables/disables strict rules enforcement.
- **Corebook conformance labels** — clearly distinguishes core items from extended content.
- **Staged penetration toggle** — disable for compatible/simplified play.
- **Direct commit mode** option — skip preview for speed.

### Architecture

- **Resolver layer** (`module/combat/`) — pure mechanics modules with zero Foundry runtime dependency. `CombatOutcome` is the single source of truth for chat, preview, commit, and tests.
- **State planner** — planned updates collected and validated before any Foundry document mutates.
- **Deterministic fixtures** — 7 JSON fixture files + 2356 lines of test assertions covering all combat modes, runnable outside a live world.
- **No bundler, no TypeScript, no build step.** Plain JS ES modules loaded directly by Foundry.

### Compendia

Full item packs for: default skills, role-specific skills, weapons, armor, cyberware/chipware, gear categories, vehicles, roll tables.

### Localization

| Language | File |
|---|---|
| **English** | `lang/en.json` |
| **Spanish** | `lang/es.json` |
| **Italian** | `lang/it.json` |

## What's Not Yet Done

- **Netrunning** — deferred (low usage in most campaigns).
- **Mech sheet** — planned for later.
- **Scene / map cover automation** — cover is manual input only.
- **Active Effects for cyberware** — cyberware stats don't auto-modify actor stats.
- **Full Foundry ApplicationV2** — architecture is v10/v11/v12 compatible (verified up to v12, maximum v13), but a full transition to ApplicationV2 is deferred.

See [`docs/`](./docs/) and [`_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md`](./_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md) for detailed scope tracking.

## Development Notes

### Stack

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Plain JavaScript ES modules (Foundry client runtime) |
| **Entrypoint** | `module/cyberpunk2020-rilerena.js` via `system.json → esmodules` |
| **Actor** | `CyberpunkActor` (`module/actor/actor.js`) |
| **Item** | `CyberpunkItem` (`module/item/item.js`) |
| **Sheets** | Foundry `ActorSheet` / `ItemSheet` subclasses + Handlebars `.hbs` |
| **Combat resolver** | `module/combat/` — pure JS modules |
| **Styling** | Sass → `css/cyberpunk2020-rilerena.css` |
| **Data model** | `template.json` (Foundry system template) |
| **Tests** | Node.js assertion tests with JSON fixtures under `tests/combat/` |

### How to Contribute

1. Clone the repo into your Foundry `systems/` directory.
2. Edit `.scss` files (not `.css`) and compile:
   ```bash
   sass scss/cyberpunk2020-rilerena.scss css/cyberpunk2020-rilerena.css
   ```
   Or auto-compile on save:
   ```bash
   sass --watch scss/cyberpunk2020-rilerena.scss css/cyberpunk2020-rilerena.css
   ```
3. Run combat fixture tests:
   ```bash
   node tests/combat/combat-fixtures.test.js
   ```
4. Load Foundry, select the **Cyberpunk 2020** system, and create a world to test UI changes.
